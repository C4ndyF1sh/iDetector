# iChecker
**A very simple App to check if a App is installed or if a File Path is valid.**
- (Checking a **Bundle ID** requires **18.4.1 or lower**)
- (Checking a **File Path** works on the **latest OS version** and will probably **never** get "patched" since it **doesnÂ´t** uses a exploit)

# Bundle IDs can be found through the following ways:
- https://vexelon.net/asws 
- https://github.com/joeblau/apple-bundle-identifiers
